/**
 * Delete every user table's rows, leaving schema and migration journal
 * intact. Called by the harness's `beforeEach` hook.
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 * - FK is toggled via `sqlite.pragma` (one-shot on the connection) so
 *   enforcement is restored right after the truncation.
 * - `__drizzle_migrations` is preserved so the schema stays set up across
 *   tests.
 * - FTS5 virtual tables and their shadow tables (`_data`, `_config`,
 *   `_docsize`, `_idx`) are skipped; the base table's AFTER DELETE trigger
 *   cascades FTS cleanup (SQLite-standard behaviour).
 * - `sqlite_sequence` may not exist if no AUTOINCREMENT columns are defined;
 *   we ignore that error.
