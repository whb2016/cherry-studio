/**
 * Stateless bounds I/O for WindowManager's "remember bounds" capability.
 *
 * A free-function module (not a class) mirroring `behavior.ts`'s `applyWindowBehavior`
 * — there is no per-tracker state to hold: the only durable state is the
 * `window.bounds` record in the main-process persist cache, and the only runtime
 * toggle (the override map) lives on WindowManager. Each function resolves the
 * CacheService lazily via `application.get` so the module has no init-time
 * service dependency.
 *
 * Storage shape: `window.bounds` is a `Record<WindowType, WindowBoundsState>`.
 * This module is its sole writer; WindowManager gates every call behind
 * `shouldRememberBounds(type)` (singleton-only), so only singleton window types
 * ever appear as keys.
