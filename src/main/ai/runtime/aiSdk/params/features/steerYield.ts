 * Yield the running chat turn at the next safe step boundary when a steer message is queued for the

 * cleanly (persisted as success) and `AiStreamManager` chains a continuation that answers the steer.
 *
 * Chat-only: the `applies` guard excludes agent-session topics — they absorb mid-flight messages
 * through their own runtime queue (`pendingTurns`), not this params-path yield condition.
