/**
 * Crash consistency for install / update / rollback / uninstall.
 *
 * The dangerous window is between "files moved into place" and "rows committed".
 * A crash can land on either side of that line and the two sides need OPPOSITE
 * repairs — delete the files, or keep them — so this cannot be a cleanup pass that
 * deletes whatever it finds. The committed row is the only witness of which side
 * the crash fell on, so every entry carries the contentHash the row will hold and
 * recovery joins on it.
 *
 * Recorded in a plain JSON file rather than the database, because the database is
 * exactly the component that has not caught up yet.
 *
 * NO PATHS ARE STORED. Every path is derived from `miniAppInstallPath(appId)` at
 * recovery time. A persisted absolute path goes stale on userData relocation just
 * as it would in the database — and here the stale value would be the target of a
 * recursive delete.
