/**
 * SqliteDriver backed by a synchronous better-sqlite3 connection (the only engine).
 *
 * No internal write mutex: every writer (rebuildMaterial / deleteMaterials /
 * reclaimSpace) runs under `KeyedMutex.runExclusive(baseId, ...)`, a
 * per-base async-mutex that already serializes all writes to a base's index — so the
 * driver never self-serializes. better-sqlite3's single connection makes
 * `transaction` inherently atomic; reads run on the same connection and ride WAL /
 * busy_timeout. `transaction` uses better-sqlite3's native `db.transaction(fn).immediate`
 * (BEGIN IMMEDIATE, matching the old libsql 'write' tx) rather than hand-rolled
 * BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK: it runs `fn` synchronously to completion in one JS turn, so
 * BEGIN and COMMIT can never straddle an event-loop yield — no unrelated read on this
 * connection can ever observe a transaction mid-flight. It also throws `TypeError` if
 * `fn` returns a Promise, turning an accidental async callback into a loud failure
 * instead of a silent early commit.
 *
 * NOTE (future KB-owner cleanup): the driver trusts callers to hold the base lock and does not
 * self-check it. A cheap `transactionActive` reentrancy assertion in {@link transaction} could
 * turn a forgotten lock into an explicit driver error instead of SQLite's opaque "cannot start
 * a transaction within a transaction" — worth considering, intentionally left out of this migration.
