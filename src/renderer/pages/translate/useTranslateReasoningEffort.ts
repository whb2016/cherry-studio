/**
 * Translate's reasoning-effort selection, read alongside the configured model.
 *
 * The stored selection is never rewritten to fit the current model, matching
 * what the composers do. Main resolves the stored value per request instead:
 * to the nearest effort the model does declare, or — when it declares none at
 * all, or cannot turn thinking off — to no reasoning parameter. So pointing
 * translate at a model with a narrower vocabulary, including when picking a
 * default model cascades into `feature.translate.model_id`, costs the user
 * nothing, and pointing it back returns the effort they chose.
 *
 * The display is more conservative than the wire: `ModelSpeedControl` shows
 * provider Default for an effort the model does not declare, while the request
 * carries the nearest one. That split is the composers' too — worth knowing
 * when reading a log line that names an effort the popover never showed.
