/**
 * The app's router type. `TabRouter` annotates its factory with this, so a router built with
 * non-default options fails there rather than drifting from what is registered here.
 *
 * Pass it explicitly — `useSearch<AppRouter>()`. Left to its `RegisteredRouter` default, the
 * type argument re-enters the `Register` -> route tree -> `Route<Register>` cycle, and
 * TypeScript breaks that cycle by falling back to `any` at whichever call sites it reaches
 * mid-resolution: the search type silently degrades with nothing failing to report it.
