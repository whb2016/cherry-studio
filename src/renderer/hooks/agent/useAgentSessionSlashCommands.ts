/**
 * The live slash command catalog for an agent session, captured from the Claude Code SDK
 * (`query.supportedCommands()`) and published into the shared cache by the main process. Includes
 * custom project/user commands — not just the static builtin set. Returns `undefined` when no
 * session is selected or the runtime hasn't reported a catalog yet, so callers fall back to the
 * builtin list. The cached SDK shape (`name` without a leading slash) is normalised to the
 * composer's `{ command, description }` form here.
 *
 * Main owns this key, so this window must only ever read it — `useSharedCacheValue` never seeds
 * the schema default back (which would clobber Main's already-published catalog during the mount
 * race before the initial sync lands) and never pins the key.
