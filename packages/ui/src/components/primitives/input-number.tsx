/**
 * A number field that owns the text being typed, so partial input like `"1."`,
 * `"-"` or `"3.9"` survives while the caret is in it.
 *
 * Because it owns that text it must settle it when the caret leaves: on
 * blur/Enter the field normalizes what was typed — clamped into `[min, max]`,
 * truncated when `step` is an integer — and hands the result to `onBlur`.
 * **Settling is not configurable**; a field cannot be left showing `"1."`.
 * An incomplete numeric prefix that is still not a number on commit restores
 * the value from the start of the edit; only an actually empty field settles
 * to `null`.
 *
 * What `onBlur` hands over is a fact — "this is the value the field settled
 * on" — and the meaning is the caller's: persist it, ignore it, diff it against
 * something else. But the field renders `value`, never its own result, so the
 * normalized value reaches the screen only once the caller routes it back.
 * `onValueChange` never normalizes, which makes `onBlur` the callback nearly
 * every caller needs.
 *
 * Both callbacks take the value, not the DOM event: the raw `FocusEvent` would
 * be misleading here anyway, since `event.target.value` at that point is still
 * the text the user typed.
 *
 * `min`/`max` mean *clamp into this range on commit*, which is only meaningful
 * where the number is a magnitude — where larger and smaller say something, so a
 * bound is a sensible answer to a value beyond it. Where the number is an
 * identifier (a port, an id) its size means nothing and clamping would invent a
 * value nobody chose: pass no range and validate in the caller instead.
 *
 * A minus sign is therefore always typable. Whether the value may be negative is
 * a range question, settled on commit like any other, not a keystroke question.
 *
 * `min > max` is a call-site bug: no number satisfies it, so the field settles on
 * none. Committing yields `null` and the arrows refuse to step, which empties the
 * field on every commit — visible enough to find in development, where a silent
 * pick between the two bounds would not be. It warns on every render too.
 *
 * The field is a spin button: ArrowUp/ArrowDown step by `step`, straight into
 * `[min, max]` — an arrow press is a whole gesture, not a half-typed number, so
 * the caret cannot be trapped and the next *allowed* value is what was asked
 * for. Stepping reports like typing does and still settles on blur/Enter. The
 * range rides along in `aria-value*`, without which a screen-reader user has no
 * way to know a bound exists until the silent clamp on blur moves their number.
 * The wheel is deliberately left alone: over a `type="text"` field it scrolls
 * the page, which is what someone scrolling past a form means.
 *
 * Escape discards the edit and stops there. It restores what the edit started
 * from — reported through `onValueChange`, since a live-coupled caller has
 * already been told the typed value — and does not bubble, because the app exits
 * fullscreen on any Escape reaching `window` and this one is already spent.

   *
   * Any caller that persists the value wants this one — it is the only callback
   * that hands over a settled value. It both normalizes (so without it
   * `min`/`max`/`step` never reach a committed value — declaring `min`/`max` and
   * skipping this is worse than decorative: they still publish an `aria` range
   * that nothing enforces) and restores an abandoned incomplete edit (`-`, `1e`)

   * so declaring none of the three is not a licence to skip this: a caller that
   * persists through `onValueChange` alone keeps whatever the emptying before
   * the incomplete text wrote. Only a consumer that is purely live-coupled —
